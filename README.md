# Bike-Share Opportunity

##Overview 
Trying to start a new company is always difficult especially when looking for investors. One way to attract investors is to come up with a well thought out business plan and be able to present findings in a neat and clear way. This analysis did just that! By analyzing targets from time / day of the week, gender and nearby tourist attractions, analyzing and visualizing a viable company can be possible. 

## Results:
First, we must analyze the type of user we are targeting, if it is either a long-term subscriber or a short-term customer. According to the graph below, the majority of the users are subscribers, at 81%.

Next, from all of the trips taken, we should know what time our bikes will be most used. According to the chart below, morning comuters (6am-9am) and evening commuters (5pm-7pm) are the weightiest out of the entire day.

Next, we should look at men vs woman vs unknown. Since not all persons are identified in one or the other category, we must identify them as ‘unknown’. In the chart below, there is significantly more men riding bikes throughout the day.

Next comes age. According to the graph below, the consistent bike riders are that of age 32.

One of the last few things to analyze are where these folks going to. If we analyze starting locations, we are able to visualize where these folks first rent out the bikes. Looking at a map of Manhattan, we can see that the most used areas are that of the city. Probably to avoid traffic!

## Summary
From our analysis, it looks like the target audiences are men for their morning and evening commutes! So perhaps more rustic designed bikes may help! 
However, investors want to know more about revenue/expenditures more than anything. More analysis regarding expected profit would e valuable for future investors.  
The last thing we would probably need to research is where these folks are going to in such a short amount of time. Most likely, these folks maybe local and commuting to work? Or are frequent NYC visitors? Further research would need to be conducted.
